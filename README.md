# [Fa](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa_(letter)>) programming language

> A rys-like stack based, reverse polish notation low-level programming
> language that transpiles down to assembly

# Note

Do not contribute to the python script, it will be deleted eventually,
for any ideas make an issue and also in **no way** is this currently
a production-friendly language

# Goal

Fa programming language is supposed to be similar to rys but
fixing a lot of issues it has, the initial name for fa was
rys++ but I ended up on fa, this language is going to be self-hosted
some time
