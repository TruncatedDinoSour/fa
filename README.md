# [Fa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa_(letter)) programming language

> A rys-like stack based, reverse polish notation low-level programming
> language that transpiles down to assembly

# Note

Do not contribute to the python script, it will be deleted eventually,
for any ideas make an issue

# Goal

Fa programming language is supposed to be similar to rys but
fixing a lot of issues it has, the initial name for fa was
rys++ but I ended up on fa, this language is meant to be self-hosted
some time

# System requirements

- Binutils/`ld` linker
- `Yasm` compiler
- `Python3` (for now)

# Installation for developing

```bash
$ ./scripts/devsetup.sh
```
