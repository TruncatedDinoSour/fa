# Arguments in fa

To get access to arguments use `argv` and `argc` keywords,
`argv` will give the pointer to arguments and `argc` will
give you the total argument count, everything after
`argv` is `envp`

To make argument parsing nicer there's a file called `args.fa`
in stdlib, I suggest you to use it :)
